1. I've developed a screen called "Notes" and integrated it within the App.js file.

2. Added a floating button that opens a modal, allowing input for title and content.

3. At the bottom of the modal, there's an icon that triggers a color palette selection.

4. Selecting a color from the palette updates the modal's color scheme.

5. Clicking the back arrow i have added the add button on back arrow then it navigates back to the main screen, displaying the latest note at the top.

6. A delete icon prompts an alert box with options "Cancel" and "Yes." "Cancel" dismisses alert,while "Yes" removes a specific note by its index.

7. Modifying note content is possible by clicking on any note.

8. A search bar, positioned at the top, filters notes as characters are entered.
